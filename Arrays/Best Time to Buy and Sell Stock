// well it is easy problem . so brute aproach is simply using two for loops and calculating the differcne by each iterations and 
// return the hightest profit. O(n2) s.c -0(1)
 // optimal approach is by using only one loop ,storing the leastprice as we go and also calculating the profit we get from the price
..code
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int lowestBuy = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){                                     T.C =o(n)  S.c -O(1).
            lowestBuy = Math.min(lowestBuy,prices[i]);
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - lowestBuy);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
